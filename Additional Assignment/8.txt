Develop a program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., "radar" or "madam"). Prompt the user to enter a string, then use a loop to compare characters from the beginning and end of the string to determine if it's a palindrome.



start
Prompt user to enter a string and store as string
 Set start to 0
 Set end to length of string - 1
 Set is_palindrome to True
 While start < end:
   1. If string[start] != string[end]:
      Set is_palindrome to False
      Break
   2. Increment start
   3. Decrement end
 If is_palindrome is True:
      Print string is a palindrome
   Else:
      Print string is not a palindrome
end
