Write a program that calculates the discount amount for a product based on the following criteria:
If the product price is over $100 and the customer is a premium member, they get a 20% discount.
If the product price is over $100 and the customer is not a premium member, they get a 10% discount.
If the product price is $100 or less, there is no discount.
Prompt the user to input the product price and their premium membership status, then use complex logical expressions to calculate and output the discount amount.

start
Prompt user to enter product price and store as product_price
 Prompt user to enter premium membership status (yes/no) and store as is_premium_member
 If product_price > 100:
   - If is_premium_member == 'yes':
     - Calculate discount_amount = 0.20 * product_price
   - Else:
     - Calculate discount_amount = 0.10 * product_price
 Else:
   - Set discount_amount = 0
 Print "Discount amount: $" + formatted discount_amount with two decimal places
end
