Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a loop. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is denoted by n! and is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120. Prompt the user to enter a number, then use a loop to calculate and output its factorial.

start
Input Get a number num from the user.
Check Input
   - If num is negative, stop and show an error message.
   - If num is zero, output 1 and stop.
Set Initial Value: Start with \( factorial = 1 \).
Calculate Factorial
   - Multiply \( factorial \) by each number from 1 to num.
Output
