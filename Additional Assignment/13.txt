Design a program that determines whether a person is eligible for a particular health insurance plan based on the following criteria:
Age must be between 18 and 65.
Must not have any pre-existing medical conditions.
Must not have any recent hospitalizations (within the last 6 months).
Prompt the user to input their age, medical condition status, and hospitalization status, then use complex logical expressions to determine and output whether they are eligible for the insurance plan.

start
 Prompt user to enter age and store as age
Prompt user to enter medical condition status (yes/no) and store as has_medical_condition
Prompt user to enter hospitalization status (yes/no) and store as recent_hospitalization
 If age >= 18 AND age <= 65 AND has_medical_condition == 'no' AND recent_hospitalization == 'no':
   - Print "Congratulations! You are eligible for the health insurance plan."
   Else:
   - Print "Sorry, you are not eligible for the health insurance plan."
