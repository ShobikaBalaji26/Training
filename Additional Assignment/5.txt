Develop a number guessing game where the program randomly generates a number between 1 and 100. The user has to guess the number, and the program provides feedback (higher, lower, or correct) after each guess. Use a loop to allow the user to keep guessing until they correctly guess the number.

start
Generate random number between 1 and 100 and save it as secret number
 Print "Guess the number between 1 and 100"
 Loop:
   1. Ask user for a guess
   2. If guess == secret_number:
      Print "Congratulations! You guessed it!"
      End loop
   3. If guess < secret_number:
      Print "Too low! Guess higher."
   4. If guess > secret_number:
      Print "Too high! Guess lower."
end
