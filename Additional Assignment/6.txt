Create a program that generates and displays all prime numbers within a specified range (e.g., between 1 and 100). Use nested loops to iterate through each number in the range and determine if it's a prime number. A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

start
Ask user for start and end of the range
 For each num from start to end:
   1. If num < 2, go to next number
   2. Set is_prime to True
   3. For each i from 2 to sqrt(num):
      If num % i == 0, set is_prime to False
   4. If is_prime is True, print num
end
