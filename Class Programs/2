Develop a number guessing game where the program randomly generates a number between 1 and 100. The user has to guess the number, and the program provides feedback (higher, lower, or correct) after each guess. Use a loop to allow the user to keep guessing until they correctly guess the number.

 import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class NumberGuessingGame {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        Random random = new Random();

        int randomNumber = random.nextInt(100) + 1;
        int guess;
        int attempts = 0;

        System.out.println("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!");
        System.out.println("I have chosen a number between 1 and 100. Try to guess it!");

        do {
            System.out.print("Enter your guess: ");
            guess = scanner.nextInt();
            attempts++;

            if (guess < 1 || guess > 100) {
                System.out.println("Please enter a number between 1 and 100.");
                continue;
            }

            if (guess < randomNumber) {
                System.out.println("Higher!");
            } else if (guess > randomNumber) {
                System.out.println("Lower!");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Congratulations! You guessed the number in " + attempts + " attempts.");
            }

        } while (guess != randomNumber);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
