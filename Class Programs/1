Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a loop. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is denoted by n! and is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120. Prompt the user to enter a number, then use a loop to calculate and output its factorial.


import java.util.Scanner;

public class FactorialCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a non-negative integer to calculate its factorial: ");
        int number = scanner.nextInt();

        if (number < 0) {
            System.out.println("Please enter a non-negative integer.");
            return;
        }

        long factorial = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
            factorial *= i;
        }

        System.out.println(number + "! = " + factorial);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
